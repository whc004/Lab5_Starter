## 1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.
### Since it have the inteaction between the user and the message reciever which involve multiple system components and external dependencies, I won't choose to use a unit test to test it.

## 2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.
### Since it only test the length of the max message length which is an isolated features, I would choose to use a unit test to test it.
